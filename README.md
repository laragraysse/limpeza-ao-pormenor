### üìë ABOUT THE WEBSITE
This website was developed to spread the company's online presence and their services. This is a website with a lot of responsiveness, although it might be some mistakes or bugs because unfortunately I couldn't manage to make it 100% perfect but since I'm responsible of the maintenance, I'll make some improvements in the meantime. <br>

This website has 4 pages. They are: <br>
<details>
  <summary>In√≠cio</summary> <br>
  <p> the In√≠cio page has:</p>
  - the menu. <br>
  - the header with a background picture, a small paragraph introducing the company and it's services, a button redirecting to the Sobre N√≥s page and another button redirecting to the Servi√ßos page right to the fixed prices section. <br>
  - a section for the company's services features. <br>
  - a section with slogan and a button redirecting to the Servi√ßos page. <br>
  - a section with FAQ. <br>
  - the footer with the logo and buttons redirecting to the company's social media, email and telephone number.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Sobre N√≥s</summary> <br>
  <p> the Sobre N√≥s page has:</p>
  - the menu. <br>
  - a whole section with details about the company and it's services, with a button at the bottom of the section that redirects to the Servi√ßos page slider. <br>
  - the footer with the logo and buttons redirecting to the company's social media, email and telephone number.
</details>

<details>

  - a section with the most asked services and it's fixed prices, with buttons that redirects to the email with an automatic message that can be diferent depending on the service. <br>
  - the footer with the logo and buttons redirecting to the company's social media, email and telephone number.
</details>

  - a section with a contact form. <br>
  - a section with the company's business hours and location. <br>

### üíª USED TECHNOLOGIES
On this website I worked with: <br>
- HTML5.
- CSS3.
- Javascript (jQuery).
- Swiper Lib for the Slider.
- Scroll Reveal.

### üìö WHAT DID I LEARN
I learned a bit more of jQuery in practice and I really liked it but of course I have a lot to improve and I need to get deeper in the studies so I can mantain a clean and comprehensive code. Plus, at the same time I loved, I hated the responsiveness part on this website but I really learned A LOT! I learned a bit more of flexbox and grid, I used both on this project but after a few time I'll improve this as well. I learned so much stuff that I can't even manage to remember and detail each thing right now ahah, but I won't ever forget this project. Gave me a little bit of headache but I really liked the result!

### üîè PRIVACY
On this project repository I won't upload the files of the website's code to preserve the data privacy of the company.
